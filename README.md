# Real-Time-Modulation
Analysis and write up for a project investigating whether and how listeners with lots, some, or no musical training perceive modulations in the course of music listening.

There are two RMDs and two PDFs here. The first, RTMPapa, is the write up, in APA style, of this analysis. It's much more detailed and features a few images not present in the article version. RTMParticle is the article - style write up that is being prepared for publication.
